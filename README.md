## Workshop Legend

This repository has a lot of stuff going on! For your convenience, here are all of the workshop materials, divided up by topic.

### React

The "actual" workshop; this is what you need to get your project up and running, and learn the basics of React!

0. [Setting up Node.js and a quick project tour](https://github.com/malsf21/qwerhacks-21-workshops/tree/main/react/node-setup-and-tour)
1. Hello World with React and Create React App
2. Creating Your First Component
3. Hooks and State in React
4. Common React Patterns: Lists, Forms, and Conditional Rendering
5. Using GitHub and Netlify to Deploy Your App For Free

Some bonus content! Feel free to check these out if they interest you, but you might not need them for your project.

* [Should I use React in my hackathon project?](https://github.com/malsf21/qwerhacks-21-workshops/tree/main/react/should-i-use-react)
* Classes vs Hooks in React
* The `useEffect` hook
* Some Useful React Resources

### Firebase (Cloud Firestore)

The "actual" workshop; here, we create a simple vanilla JS app and integrate Firebase.

0. Setting up Firestore and the Firebase Console
1. Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting data with Firestore
2. Listeners, Transactions, Querying

And some extra goodies:

* Cloud Firestore versus Realtime Database
* Using Firebase with React: the `useEffect` hook (do the React one first!)
* Some other cool Firebase products

## FAQs

### What do I need to know to take X workshop?

For both the React and Firestore workshops, I do assume that you've seen *a little bit* of HTML and CSS, and have used a programming language before. If it's JavaScript, that helps, but syntactically it's pretty similar to most other languages you might've encountered (e.g. C++, Python, Java).

If you haven't used HTML and CSS before, it's not the worst deal in the world, but we'd recommend that you brush up on those first! Check out Interneting Is Hard's [Basic Web Pages](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/basic-web-pages/) and [Hello, CSS](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/hello-css/) tutorials for a quick read, or maybe [ACM Hack's Intro HTML/CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sttIgSTnSg0) for a longer watch.

If the JavaScript portion of the React workshop confused you, it may be worth spending a bit of time catching up on that first! For a short-ish read, Javascript.info's [JavaScript Fundamentals](https://javascript.info/first-steps) are solid, as is Lisa Tagliaferri and Tania Rascia's [How To Code in JavaScript series](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-code-in-javascript); for a longer watch, check out [ACM Hack's Intro to JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk9kob-9Wkw).

### I'm a bit stuck on my project during the hackathon. Can I get help?

Yup! More deets coming soon!

### I've got a question on a topic that's not directly covered in a tutorial. Where should I look for help?

Good question! Luckily for us, the internet has tons of great resources, including Google! If a quick Google isn't super helpful, consider:

* poking around the official docs: [here are React's](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) (which are quite solid), and [here are Firestore's](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore).
* skimming other tutorials: [React has a great official tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), and [Firebase's](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) is alright too. [Tania Rascia has a great React tutorial too](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/)!
* use [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)! There's no shame, and it's likely that many others have run into your problem too!
* ask us! QWER Hacks has a mentor system; more info TBD.

He'd also like to thank ACM Hack for Hackschool, which covers many intro to web development topics; he borrowed the BTS Twitter photos used in "[Should I use React in my hackathon project?](https://github.com/malsf21/qwerhacks-21-workshops/tree/main/react/should-i-use-react)" from their [Hackschool 2020, Intro to React Workshop](https://github.com/uclaacm/hackschool-f20/tree/main/session-7-intro-react).
