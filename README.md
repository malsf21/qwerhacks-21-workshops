## Workshop Legend

This repository has a lot of stuff going on! For your convenience, here are all of the workshop materials, divided up by topic.

### React

The React 101 core workshop; this is what you need to get your project up and running, and learn the basics of React! This is broken up into bite-sized chunks, where each chunk is ~ 5-8 minutes.

0. [Setting up Node.js and a quick project tour](https://github.com/malsf21/qwerhacks-21-workshops/tree/main/react/node-setup-and-tour) (written)
1. [Hello World with React and Create React App](https://github.com/malsf21/qwerhacks-21-workshops/tree/main/react/main-workshop#hello-world-with-react-and-create-react-app)

[Here's the YouTube playlist for the videos in order, for your convenience](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPO7_kXilXFbpznCbpni9fjg7MKU7lyKS).

Some bonus content! Feel free to check these out if they interest you, but you might not need them for your project.

* [Using Firestore with React: the `useEffect` hook](https://github.com/malsf21/qwerhacks-21-workshops/tree/main/firebase/with-react)

### Firebase (Cloud Firestore)

The "actual" workshop; here, we take a simple vanilla JS app and integrate Firebase. Similar to the React videos, the workshop is broken up into small chunks!

0. [Setting up Firestore and the Firebase Console](https://github.com/malsf21/qwerhacks-21-workshops/tree/main/firebase/main-workshop#setting-up-firestore-and-the-firebase-console)
1. [Basic Data Operatins (CRUD) in Firestore](https://github.com/malsf21/qwerhacks-21-workshops/tree/main/firebase/main-workshop#basic-data-operations-crud-in-firestore):
    * [Creating Sample Data](https://github.com/malsf21/qwerhacks-21-workshops/tree/main/firebase/main-workshop#creating-sample-data) and [Reading it](https://github.com/malsf21/qwerhacks-21-workshops/tree/main/firebase/main-workshop#basic-read-operations)
    * Programatically [Creating](https://github.com/malsf21/qwerhacks-21-workshops/tree/main/firebase/main-workshop#creating-data-programatically), [Deleting](https://github.com/malsf21/qwerhacks-21-workshops/tree/main/firebase/main-workshop#deleting-data), and [Updating](https://github.com/malsf21/qwerhacks-21-workshops/tree/main/firebase/main-workshop#updating-data) Data

### Education Track

I did the video intro for the education track! You [watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhtwVRjKosg) or read [a rough outline of my script](https://github.com/malsf21/qwerhacks-21-workshops/tree/main/education-track).

## FAQs

### What do I need to know to take X workshop?

For both the React and Firestore workshops, I do assume that you've seen *a little bit* of HTML and CSS, and have used a programming language before. If it's JavaScript, that helps, but syntactically it's pretty similar to most other languages you might've encountered (e.g. C++, Python, Java).

If you haven't used HTML and CSS before, it's not the worst deal in the world, but we'd recommend that you brush up on those first! Check out Interneting Is Hard's [Basic Web Pages](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/basic-web-pages/) and [Hello, CSS](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/hello-css/) tutorials for a quick read, or maybe [ACM Hack's Intro HTML/CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sttIgSTnSg0) for a longer watch.

If the JavaScript portion of the React workshop confused you, it may be worth spending a bit of time catching up on that first! For a short-ish read, Javascript.info's [JavaScript Fundamentals](https://javascript.info/first-steps) are solid, as is Lisa Tagliaferri and Tania Rascia's [How To Code in JavaScript series](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-code-in-javascript); for a longer watch, check out [ACM Hack's Intro to JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk9kob-9Wkw).

### I'm a bit stuck on my project during the hackathon. Can I get help?

Yup! More deets coming soon!

### I've got a question on a topic that's not directly covered in a tutorial. Where should I look for help?

Good question! Luckily for us, the internet has tons of great resources, including Google! If a quick Google isn't super helpful, consider:

* poking around the official docs: [here are React's](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) (which are quite solid), and [here are Firestore's](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore).
* skimming other tutorials: [React has a great official tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), and [Firebase's](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) is alright too. [Tania Rascia has a great React tutorial too](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/)!
* use [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)! There's no shame, and it's likely that many others have run into your problem too!
* ask us! QWER Hacks has a mentor system; more info TBD.

He'd also like to thank ACM Hack for Hackschool, which covers many intro to web development topics; he borrowed the BTS Twitter photos used in "[Should I use React in my hackathon project?](https://github.com/malsf21/qwerhacks-21-workshops/tree/main/react/should-i-use-react)" from their [Hackschool 2020, Intro to React Workshop](https://github.com/uclaacm/hackschool-f20/tree/main/session-7-intro-react).
