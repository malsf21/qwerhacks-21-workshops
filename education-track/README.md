# Education Track Primer

This README is a generally-accurate script for [Matt's video on the **Education Track**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhtwVRjKosg), where Matt introduces the track, mentions some (hopefully) helpful advice and tips for your project, and goes over a previous submission!

This script is close to (but not quite) a word-for-word transcription of the [accompanying video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhtwVRjKosg). Either resource is fine!

## Introduction

Hey! My name is Matt, my pronouns are he/him, and I'm a third-year computer science and math-economics major at UCLA! I'm really passionate about education, and in particular, the intersection between education and technology - or EdTech. I'm super grateful to have an opportunity to work on these types of projects at ACM Teach LA, where I help lead both traditional teaching and new, interactive tech-based teaching methods. I also love teaching and mentoring devs, and love doing it at QWER Hacks - super excited to see what you will do!

In this short video, I want to spend some time introducing you to the hackathon track and offer some general tips and tricks for your own education project!

## The Education Track

**Education** is one of the [four tracks at QWER Hacks 2021](https://www.qwerhacks.com/). We're interested in how your project can *celebrate and uplift underrepresented voices*, but more broadly, to make education more accessible, inclusive, and effective.

Admittedly, that's pretty vague. So what are we looking for? The short answer is, really anything related to education! We equally welcome projects that help small audiences to generalist tools; projects that focus on "traditional" academic education or learning in the most broad way possible; projects used by teachers, students, administrators, parents, friends, and anyone in between! Long story short, if you feel like your project fits within education, it probably fits in this track!

In terms of judging and assessment, there are two track-specific criterion in the judging rubric:

1. How relevant + important was the project focus to the team's chosen track?
2. How creatively did the team's project tackle a problem within their domain of choice? (double-weight)

Here, we're looking for **relevance + importance** and **creativity**! In particular, note how much emphasis we've put into creative solutions: EdTech is definitely an underexplored field, and we'd love to see what your take is on how we can make it better!

## Tips and Tricks

We want to see you succeed at QWER Hacks! Here are a few tips and tricks on how to scope out, build, and present your project - feel free to use as little or as many of these as you'd like!

### Project Ideas and Scope

Coming up with education ideas is hard! So, I'll spend the most time on this.

My biggest tip is to focus on **your experience**. Consider things that:

* frustrate you about school in general
* currently frustrate you with virtual learning in a pandemic
* you've struggled to learn, for X reason
* you've always wanted to learn, but didn't get around because X reason
* are hard to learn in their current form (especially if interactivity would help)

In my *personal* experience with hackathons, making a small app that really solves a niche problem, but does it really well, is both easier and more impactful than making an app that *solves everything*. I think this is especially true with education, because the current industry is pretty slow, resistant to change, and doesn't do much technical innovation - and often doesn't pay attention to minority voices.

And of course, keep in mind that education isn't just math, english, and history! Education also includes:

* learning about social issues
* creating tools for students and educators
* dealing with "life" skills like personal finance or health
* developing accessible education content
* intersectional approaches to "traditional" education
* and more!

In particular, there's lots of LGBTQIA+ issues that could benefit from innovative education. Consider:

* innovative ways to present queer history, theory, and language
* how inaccurate, ineffective, and *boring* some online diversity trainings are!
* queer-friendly educational services that priortize inclusivity
* and more!

I just want to emphasize again that chipping away at problems with tailor-fit solutions is great! Not only does it lead to manageable hackathon projects, it also lets you fill the gaps in our current education system - and hopefully make the world just *that* much better.

### Building

Here, I'll be a bit more brief!

First, this is a hackathon! It's not a Series A or an IPO. It's **100% fine** if your project doesn't fully work, have some bugs, or need some polish. Your job is to create a proof-of-concept that shows that this is an interesting idea, that could warrant further exploration!

The other piece of building advice I'll give is you should really hammer out one use-case/workflow, rather than spread your time across a bunch of them. Impressive proof-of-concepts really nail a specific part of the problem that they try to solve, and let the audience + judges extrapolate! It also lets you focus in on learning a specific technology, design pattern, etc.

### Presenting and Pitching

QWER Hacks already has an amazing pitch workshop coming up, but my quick two cents on pitching: really focus on how your idea is better head-to-head than the existing status quo. If you can paint a narrative for the judges on what's currently wrong, and how your project makes education *that much better*, you've done their work for them! I'd encourage you to highlight the *creative solution* you've presented, since that's weighted in judging.

## Previous Projects and Inspirations

One of my favourite projects from QWER Hacks 2020 was [qspace](https://devpost.com/software/qspace). Two hackers developed a beautiful, visually engaging set of mini-modules. Their app allows users in many different situations - from parents of gay teenagers to friends of someone coming out as asexual - to step through their responses and figure out the best way to support the queer community. In their words,

> We chose to create fillable answers to simulate more natural responses rather than just multiple choice. In this way we were trying to get people to think critically about interactions rather than mindlessly filling out modules.

Stepping back from QWER Hacks, one of my all-time inspirations for interactive education is [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/). They've made some absolutely gorgeous and engaging playable games on [the prisoner's dilemma](https://ncase.me/trust/), [diversity and bias in large groups of people](https://ncase.me/polygons/), and even [an interactive exploration of their own coming out experience](https://ncase.itch.io/coming-out-simulator-2014).

## Last Thoughts

Hackathons are a place to grow and learn, and we want to help you do that! It's totally reasonable to be stressed or feel nervous about building a project in such a short timeframe, but we know you can do it - and we're here to support you! If you've ever got questions or need some help, please reach out to the hackathon mentors - me included - we'd love to help you!

I'm **so excited** to see what y'all will build. Good luck hacking!
